var width = 640,
    height = 480;

var nodes = [
    { "country": "East Timor",
    "rate": 100},
    { "country": "Canada",
    "rate": 200},
    { "country": "China",
    "rate": 300},
    { "country": "France",
    "rate": 400}
];

var links = [
  { source: 0, target: 1, graph: 100 },
  { source: 2, target: 1, graph: 200 },
  { source: 2, target: 3, graph: 500 }
];

var svg = d3.select('body').append('svg')
    .attr('width', width)
    .attr('height', height);

var force = d3.layout.force()
    .size([width, height])
    .nodes(nodes)
    .links(links);

// force.linkDistance(width/2);
force.linkDistance(function(link) {
      return link.graph;
   });

// Next we'll add the nodes and links to the visualization.
// Note that we're just sticking them into the SVG container
// at this point. We start with the links. The order here is
// important because we want the nodes to appear "on top of"
// the links. SVG doesn't really have a convenient equivalent
// to HTML's `z-index`; instead it relies on the order of the
// elements in the markup. By adding the nodes _after_ the
// links we ensure that nodes appear on top of links.

// Links are pretty simple. They're just SVG lines, and
// we're not even going to specify their coordinates. (We'll
// let the force layout take care of that.) Without any
// coordinates, the lines won't even be visible, but the
// markup will be sitting inside the SVG container ready
// and waiting for the force layout.

var link = svg.selectAll('.link')
    .data(links)
    .enter().append('line')
    .attr('class', 'link');

// Now it's the nodes turn. Each node is drawn as a circle.

var node = svg.selectAll('.node')
    .data(nodes)
    .enter().append('circle')
    .attr('class', 'node');

// We're about to tell the force layout to start its
// calculations. We do, however, want to know when those
// calculations are complete, so before we kick things off
// we'll define a function that we want the layout to call
// once the calculations are done.

force.on('end', function() {

    // When this function executes, the force layout
    // calculations have concluded. The layout will
    // have set various properties in our nodes and
    // links objects that we can use to position them
    // within the SVG container.

    // First let's reposition the nodes. As the force
    // layout runs it updates the `x` and `y` properties
    // that define where the node should be centered.
    // To move the node, we set the appropriate SVG
    // attributes to their new values. We also have to
    // give the node a non-zero radius so that it's visible
    // in the container.

    node.attr('r', width/25)
        .attr('cx', function(d) { console.log(d.x); return d.x; })
        .attr('cy', function(d) { return d.y; });

    // We also need to update positions of the links.
    // For those elements, the force layout sets the
    // `source` and `target` properties, specifying
    // `x` and `y` values in each case.

    link.attr('x1', function(d) { return d.source.x; })
        .attr('y1', function(d) { return d.source.y; })
        .attr('x2', function(d) { return d.target.x; })
        .attr('y2', function(d) { return d.target.y; });

});

// Okay, everything is set up now so it's time to turn
// things over to the force layout. Here we go.

force.start();

// By the time you've read this far in the code, the force
// layout has undoubtedly finished its work. Unless something
// went horribly wrong, you should see two light grey circles
// connected by a single dark grey line. If you have a screen
// ruler (such as [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com) handy, measure
// the distance between the centers of the two circles. It
// should be somewhere close to the `linkDistance` parameter we
// set way up in the beginning (480 pixels). That, in the most
// basic of all nutshells, is what a force layout does. We
// tell it how far apart we want connected nodes to be, and
// the layout keeps moving the nodes around until they get
// reasonably close to that value.

// Of course, there's quite a bit more than that going on
// under the hood. We'll take a closer look starting with
// the next example.
